#      Installation       #
###########################
The extracted zip file contains four different subfolders ("Gnome-3.10_Ubuntu-14.04" "Gnome-3.12_Ubuntu-14.10" "Gnome-3.14_Ubuntu-15.04" and "Gnome-3.16") with the GTK themes for the different versions of Gnome/GTK (For Elementary OS Freya use the Gnome-3.14 version). Pick the one that matches your version and copy the content to "/usr/share/themes".

To set the right permissions, execute

sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/share/themes/Vertex

or

sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/share/themes/Vertex-Light

or

sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/share/themes/Vertex-Dark


To set the theme, run the following commands in Terminal,

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Vertex"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Vertex"

for the version with dark header-bars and toolbars or

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Vertex-Light"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Vertex-Light"

for the light version or

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Vertex-Dark"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Vertex-Dark"

for the dark version

To install the Gnome-Shell theme, copy the "Vertex-Gnome-Shell" or the "Vertex-Gnome-Shell-3.16" (if you are using Gnome 3.16) folder to "/usr/share/themes" and set the permissions

sudo chmod -R 755 "/usr/share/themes/Vertex-Gnome-Shell"

and apply the theme with 

gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name "Vertex-Gnome-Shell"

Instead of applying the theme with the gsettings commands you can select them in Gnome Tweak Tool like any other theme.

To install the Chrome/Chromium theme open the "Chrome" folder in the extracted archive and drag and drop the Vertex.crx or Vertex-light.crx file into the Chrome/Chromium window. The source of the Chrome themes is located in the source "Chrome/source" folder.

To install the Firefox theme copy the Firefox/Vertex/chrome folder to ~/.mozilla/firefox/yourprofile.default/ and restart Firefox.
Make sure that the "tools>options>content>colors use system colors" or "preferences>content>colors use system colors" checkbox is unchecked.
Themes for the variants Vertex-Light and Vertex-Dark are in the Firefox folder, too. Installation is the same.

Also included is an alternative metacity theme with hidden buttons when maximized. Installation is the same as above

#   Troubleshooting   #
#######################

If you get black spaces under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal

#######################################################################

If the metacity theme doesn't show up in gnome-tweak-tool copy the theme folder with only the metacity theme inside to ~/.local/share/themes. Otherwise gnome-tweak-tool won't find the metacity theme. (This shouldn't happen if you copy the theme to /usr/share/themes)

#######################################################################

You may face the issue that sublime text 2 won't load the theme correctly. This is due to either a bug in sublime or libpng. To fix this, download and extract the sublime-text-fix.tar.gz file and follow the instructions in the included README

#######################################################################

If you experience Gnome-Shell crashes, replace the "gnome-shell.css" file in the "Vertex-Gnome-Shell/gnome-shell/" folder with the "gnome-shell-no-crash.css" file

#######################################################################

Ubuntu-Software-Center doesn't play nice with dark themes. If you are using Vertex-Dark under Ubuntu the software center will have unreadable text.
To fix this, install the Ubuntu-Software-Center fix. Instructions and relevant files are included in the 'Ubuntu-Software-Center' folder.
